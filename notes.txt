What is the difference between running:
	git branch <branch name>
and:
	git checkout -B <branch name>
huh?

Well, by using the latter you move to the new branch, rather than merely creating it and keep working on your current branch.
Cool stuff, right?

Verify you've moved branches by running:
	git branch
and peep the name of the branch:)

NOTE:  This branch, and indeed all branches, exist in isolation even if you push code to the main repo.  All changes need to be
merged back to the main branch.

Thus the need for a pull request.  The pull request is to obtain a peer review of changed made to the branch, thus validating
that the changes are correct.  This allows for when working with teams with standards to accept pulls that meet the criteria
establish in unit testings, etc.
